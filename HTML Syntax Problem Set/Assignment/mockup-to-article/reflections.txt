Your response goes here!
  * What new skills have you learned?
    I was already pretty familiar to HTML but I reinforced the flow of executing an html file, inspecting it,
    I liked the path guide, and some tags were new to me (<figure>, <figcaption> etc.)
  * What has been easy?
    In general all the lessons were fairly easy.
  * What has been difficult?
    At this initial phase I cannot define anything as difficult.
  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?
    I did but considering the low level of difficulty, I didn't feel the frustration to quit, on the contrary,
    I did my research and solved the quizzes.
